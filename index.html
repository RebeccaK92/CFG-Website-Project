              <p>Darkness had always surrounded her, and on this dark night she decided it was time to leave. A mysterious force pulled her forward, and the little rabbit knew it would lead her to the light and happiness she longed for. So she ran down the path leading away from her home, ran as quickly as she could. The path ended, but still she ran into the dark night.</p>

              <h5>She Wished...</h5>
              <p>When Mocha finally stopped, she noticed it was nearly pitch black. Enormous trees with dense foliage towered above her, blocking the night sky, and the only remaining source of light emanated from the fireflies and eye-flies fluttering around her. 

                Mocha sat down, frightened, trying to think of what she would do next. How she wished she were someplace better! The small rabbit did not want to return to her dwelling, so all she could do was reluctantly go further into the forest. The fireflies and eye-flies quickly followed behind.  

                After a small while, a very faint light appeared, a glimmer of hope in the gloom of the forest. Mocha hopped hesitantly towards it, but quickly picked up the pace when she realised her eyes weren’t playing a trick on her.

              <h5>She Wished...</h5>
            <p>She wasn’t ready for the burst of light which ensued, and weakly blinked to get used to the brilliance of the moon above. She had entered a clearing… But she wasn’t alone. 
                
              In its centre was sat a being of light. Mocha stopped and stared warily at it, trying to discern its features, then slowly followed the fireflies and eye-flies that confidently flew to the glowing creature. 
              
              As she got closer, Mocha began to recognise a face, arms and legs. A warm voice spoke: “Do not be afraid little one. I mean you no harm.” </p>

              <h5>Are You Lost?</h5>
              <p>It was a beautiful forest nymph. The rabbit had heard rumours of their existence whispered in the wind, but had never met one before. 

                “What is a little dear like you doing in the middle of the woods so late at night? Are you lost?” 
                
                Mocha nodded sadly . The nymph cupped her hands. “Come here”, she said. The rabbit jumped obediently into them, and suddenly felt something change.

              <h5>Are You Lost?</h5>
              <p>“I have given you magic and luck. Jump from here and you will be able to cross the forest in a single leap. Now go. You will feel much better when the morning comes, I promise you.” 
                
                The nymph smiled warmly, and the rabbit licked her hand affectionately… And then jumped</p>

                  <h5>And Then She Jumped</h5>
                  <p>Mocha felt a power like no other guiding her upwards. As she rose, she saw the nymph waving goodbye, slowly becoming nothing but a shimmering dot below. The little rabbit saw the treetops, the beautiful night sky, and still she rose. Finally, she reached the stars; she jumped over the moon, and the moon grumbled tiredly.</p>

              <h5>Beyond These Meadows</h5>
              <p>As the little rabbit drifted down the clear sky, the first rays of sunlight revealed the end of the forest and the beautiful meadow ahead. Mocha couldn’t believe her eyes. 

                She landed softly on her front paws and skipped happily through the golden flowers which surrounded her, occasionally pausing to smell their sweet fragrance.</p>

           <div class = "carousel-caption my-caption">
            <h5>Among The Lavender</h5>
            <p>She then reached a hushed lavender field, and stopped. She watched as the wind blew softly through the plants, making them sway lazily and carrying their scent to her. The force which had pulled her all along had stopped, and the little rabbit understood she had reached her haven.

              She hopped through the tranquil field, nibbling here and there on the mauve flowers, and found a cosy spot in which she curled up. As she rested among the calming lavender, she thought: “I finally am somewhere I belong.”</p>
